Note: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.

Limit the number of words/sentences/characters.



Issue 2. Text focuses on the wrong details
Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.


Issue 3. Description needs a table of dimensions
